1. Basic Syntax:

Classes
	- In Java, a class is a blueprint for objects. Objects are instances of classes (Objects have behaviours of their class). The 'public class ClassName' is the declaration of a class (The class specifies how objects/instances are created and how they behave).
	- The 'main' method is the entry point of a Java program. It has a specific signature: 'public static void main(String[] args)'. It's where the program starts executing.

System.out.println:
	- 'System.out.println' is a method in the 'System' class used to print text to the console.
	- It's crucial for displaying output and debugging.


2. Data Types, Variables, and Fields:

Data Types:
	- Java has two categories of data types: primitive and reference.
	- Primitive types (e.g. 'int', 'double', 'char') hold simple values directly.
	- Reference types (e.g. 'String', arrays) holds references to objects.

Variables:
	- Variables are containers for storing data.
	- They must be declared with a type and a name, e.g. 'int age;'.
	- Variables can be assigned values: 'age = 25;'.

Fields:
	- Fields are variables that belong to a class. They define the state of an object.
	- They are declared within a class but outside any method.


3. Conditionals:

If/Else:
	- Conditional statements allow the program to make decisions based on certain conditions.
	- The 'if' statement executes a block of code if the condition is true; other, the 'else' block is executed.


4. Input from the User;

Scanner Class:
	- The 'Scanner' class in Java is part of the 'java.util' package.
	- It allows you to read different types of input (integers, strings, etc.) from the user.
	- You create a 'Scanner' object and use its methods ('nextInt()', 'nextLine()') to read input.

5. Compilation and Running Code:

javac:
	- The Java compiler ('javac') translates your human-readable Java code into bytecode, a low-level representation of your program.

java:
	- The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) executes the compiled bytecode.
	- Use the 'java' command followed by the name of the class containing the 'main' method to run your program.


6. GitHub and Version Control:

Git:
	- Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in your code over time.
	- It allows you to collaborate with others, track changes, and revert to previous versions.

GitHub:
	- GitHub is a web-based platform that hosts Git repositories.
	- It facilitates collaboration, code review, and project management.


7. Importing Libraries:

Import Statement:
	- The 'import' statement is used to include external classes or libraries in your program.
	- It helps in modularising code and avoiding naming conflicts.
